# Full-Stack Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning **frontend** and **backend** development, along with understanding their connections in a full-stack environment. The stack used includes **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the backend.

---

## Project Overview

The focus of this repository is on developing and connecting the following:

1. **Frontend**: Building a user interface using React.js, focusing on reusable components, state management, and routing.
2. **Backend**: Creating APIs using Node.js and Express.js, implementing RESTful services, and managing middleware.
3. **Database Connection**: Understanding how the backend interacts with databases (future scope for implementation).
4. **Full-Stack Integration**: Connecting the frontend and backend for seamless communication through APIs.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend (React.js)
- **Reusable Components**: Created modular components for UI development.
- **State Management**: Used React's Context API and `useState` for managing data flow.
- **Routing**: Implemented navigation using React Router.
- **API Integration**: Connected the frontend to backend APIs using `fetch` or `axios`.

### Backend (Node.js/Express.js)
- **RESTful APIs**: Designed APIs for CRUD operations.
- **Middleware**: Implemented middleware for request parsing, error handling, and logging.
- **Routing**: Used Express.js routing to manage API endpoints.
- **Authentication**: (Optional) Basic implementation of user login using JWT.

### Full-Stack Integration
- **API Communication**: Integrated React.js frontend with Node.js backend via RESTful APIs.
- **CORS Setup**: Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication.
- **Data Exchange**: Sent and received JSON data between the frontend and backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: (Future Scope) Integration with MongoDB or MySQL
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Postman, Git/GitHub
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+)
